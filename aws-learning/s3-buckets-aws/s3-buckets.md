#### AWS Buckets #
   - Buckets are the storage mediums in AWS.
   - That is, if we want to store any information in the AWS cloud, we need to create an bucket.
   - These buckets are globally unique. This mean that while creating a bucket in AWS, the bucket name should be unique across all the AWS accounts and regions.
   - Buckets are a part of S3(Simple Storage service) in AWS.
