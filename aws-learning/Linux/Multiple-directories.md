## *Creating multiple folders in Linux* #

    mkdir {1..50}
- Using this command we can create multiple directories in Linux operating system.
- This command makes directories with names as '1','2','3',.. till '50'.

- If we simply add any name before the braces, this name would be added before the number as directory name.
    mkdir demo{1..30}
- This would create directories with names starting from 'demo1','demo2',.. till 'demo30'.
