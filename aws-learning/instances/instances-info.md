# ***Instances in AWS Cloud*** #

* Instances are nothing but a virtual machine with computing resources, available over the cloud.
* We can use this instace for creating a virtual server machine which can be made using virtually available resources and can be accessed remotely. This machine can act exactly like the physical server without the need of physica hardware, this means, we can use aws instance as web server for host websites or a ftp server  for file storage security and management or a mail server for management and configuration of corporate E-mail accounts and all the other types of servers.
