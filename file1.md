# **Cloud Computing:** #
    Cloud computing is nothing but a virtual set of computing resources available centrally to the end users. These resources can be accessed by the end users from anywhere.

## *Advantages of cloud computing:* #
1.  ### Pay as you go: #

  There no need to buy the expensive hardware for CPU,DIMMs,etc. All these resources are available virtually and can be accessed using cloud services.
We just have to pay exactly for the time we are using these resources. The bill for using them is decided on the following two factors:
- Time for which the resources aare being used
- Amount of resources being used.  

2. ### On demand scale up or scale down: #

  With huge amount of computing power available we can use a specific number and type of resources that are required for our job to be done. /
  For example, if we need more computing power for a specific period of time, we can scale up our existing instances with more resources and once our job is done we can again scale down the amount of resources and we'll be billed likewise.

3. ### Outsourced management: #

  The cloud service provider manages all the resources as well as the administration services required to manage the resources.
Additionally, all the other important and expensive elements are also provided by the cloud service provider, those are given below:
* Physical security of the data centre along with the security of user data.
* Licensing of all the softwares.
* 99.9999% of uptime.

4. ### Fast development and deployment: #

  Due all the above advantages, the cost of using cloud services, financially and resources-wise to develop and deploy softwares as compared to using traditional server setups is considerably lower. Therefore, cloud is a preferred platform for development and deployment of softwares.
